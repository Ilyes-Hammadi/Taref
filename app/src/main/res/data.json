      "text": "The Polar Bear is the world's largest bear. Females can weigh over 650 lbs (300kg), while males can weigh more than double that.Polar bears are great swimmers; they have been seen in open waters hundreds of miles from land. This bear's very thick fur keeps its skin dry when it swims so it can stay warm. Their paws prevent the bears from slipping on the ice.Males are active year round, while females usually hibernate in ice dens during the winter. A female polar bear will give birth to their young inside of these ice dens, and then emerge in the spring.During summer months, polar bears will eat berries and rodents. During the winter, they eat seals",

      "text": "The Lynx has a very short tail and tufted ears. This makes it look different from other cats. Lynx live in the forest. They eat a wide variety of birds and small mammals. In North America, their diet consists largely of snowshoe hares. The North American lynxes have large round paws that help them walk on top of snow.Experts disagree on the number of lynx species. Opinions range from their being only one species of lynx to as many as three.",

      "text": "Australia does not have any native dogs of their own, but the dingo was brought there thousands of years ago. Dingos cannot bark. They have extra-large paws and their ears are always upright. Ranchers in Australia had a hard time farming because dingos attacked their animals. The farming area of southeastern Australia has a dingo-proof fence more than 3,000 miles (5,000km) long.",
